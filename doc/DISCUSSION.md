### Project goals
We will be making a Monopoly game. The game will be able to play with different rules and themes (i.e. Game of Thrones monopoly, Duke monopoly). We also want to add a lot of extra features to the project since we have a large group. 



### Project Emphasis
We plan on making a good front end, but a better backend. Generally, we are interested mostly in the backend, so we plan to focus even more on the backend implementation of the project. We also are going to focus on the design of the project because something we want to emphasize is that new versions of monopoly can be easily added. 

### Project Progress

#### Sprint 1 (Test)
First implementation: have a monopoly board with the basic rules, basic layout, and 2 players. Allow the players to pick a game piece, roll a die, have access to their own money, and take actions on their turn. The game should keep track of how many houses/properties each person has.

#### Sprint 2 (Basic)
This style will look more into the design of how the frontend looks for the project. We will add more images to each place on the board, more player images, etc. At this phase we will also add at least one other implementation of the game with a different look and some different rules. We will also have buttons at this point to change the CSS and the language of the game. If we arenâ€™t to have multiple players for the test version then we will implement more players in this version.

#### Sprint 3 (Complete)
The final version of the project will have several different versions of monopoly with different rules that the player can choose from (Jr Monopoly, Here and Now, etc) and several different themes (Duke Monopoly, Game of Thrones Monopoly, etc). Any combination of a game type and theme will work. Multiple players will be able to play, and AI players can optionally play as well.
