# Sprint 1 Completion
 1. Went above in some places (original plan for 3 players, but have a dynamic amount from 3 to 7) (have multiple themes/stylesheets to choose from)
 2. Missing key features- “the game should keep track of how many houses/properties each person has” -> this functionality isn’t implemented yet
 3. Launching the game itself
## What helped/impeded progress
 * In the past, most of us have worked primarily on the back end, so growing accustomed to implementing front-end features was time-consuming
 * Our plan really helped our progress because it was thorough enough that we had very clear jumping off points for structures and interactions
 ---
 # Significant event
 
 * Grace was originally the only one working on front-end, which was a lot of work
 * Once we divided up the front-end work more fairly, we made a lot of progress really quickly!
 * Finishing the board front-end was a really big step
 * We figured out how to integrate the data reader, the images, and the board GridPane with the front-end

 # Teamwork and Communication
 ---
 ## What worked well
 * We each worked thoroughly on our assigned tasks
 * We always communicated before merging
 * Communicated significant updates
 * Due to efficient communication, our meetings were very efficient
 * Communicated issues we were having and worked through them together
 ---
 ## What did not work well
 * We have started using the git issues system, but it is taking us some time to get used to them
 * Using the issues is a really good way to stay organized so we are trying to get more accustomed to using them!
 ## Improvements
 * Although we have issues in git that communicate what each person is working
  on, maybe it would help for team members to consistently update the group on what 
  they are currently working on
