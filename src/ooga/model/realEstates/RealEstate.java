 * This class is used to represent real estate that is purchased on a property. It has two subclasses thus far:
 * SmallEstate and LargeEstate
 * Example: When a player purchases a house in Classic Monopoly, a SmallEstate should be added to the property's
 * list of RealEstate objects so that the house is factored into rent calculation
 * Note: This class truly just serves as a storage device
