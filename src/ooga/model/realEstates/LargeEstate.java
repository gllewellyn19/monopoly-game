/**
 * This class is used to represent a large real estate that is purchased on a property. In Classic Monopoly, this would
 * be a hotel.
 * Example: When a player purchases a hotel in Classic Monopoly, a LargeEstate should be added to the property's
 * list of RealEstate objects so that the house is factored into rent calculation
 * Note: This class truly just serves as a storage device
